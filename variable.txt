1. variable naming syntax
a. cant start with a number.
b. can use special characters like $ or @
c. cant use special keywoords like let or var.

when we use let, we can change its value
but when you use const, you cannot update its value

let is used for creating a new variable, so when you update its value, you dont use let again.

camelcasing
club words together, start with lower case for first word and then use upper case for other following words.

typeof tells us data type of variable.
